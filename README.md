# Effectiveness of forward+backward contact tracing over forward contact tracing

In this project, we aim to analyse the effectiveness of forward + backward contact tracing over forward contact tracing. Using simulation models and mathematical expressions, we visualise by what factor the effectiveness increases and how the epidemic chain breaks faster on combining both forward and backward contact tracing.

The simulations are made in Tableau.
